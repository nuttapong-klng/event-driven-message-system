# Explanation of `k8s/00-namespace.yaml`

This document explains the purpose and content of the file `k8s/00-namespace.yaml`, which is responsible for creating a dedicated namespace for your event-driven message system in the Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Purpose of the File

The `k8s/00-namespace.yaml` manifest defines a Kubernetes Namespace resource named `event-driven-message-system`. This namespace is labeled for the production environment and is used to logically isolate and organize all resources related to the event-driven message system within the cluster.

---

## Structure and Content

### Namespace Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: event-driven-message-system
  labels:
    env: production
```

- **apiVersion:** Specifies the Kubernetes API version for the Namespace resource.
- **kind:** Indicates that this manifest creates a Namespace object.
- **metadata:**
  - **name:** Sets the namespace name to `event-driven-message-system`.
  - **labels:** Adds a label `env: production` to identify the environment type.

---

## Why This File Is Important

- **Resource Isolation:** Provides a dedicated namespace for all resources related to the event-driven message system, improving organization and security.
- **Environment Labeling:** The `env: production` label helps distinguish this namespace as part of the production environment, which is useful for resource management, monitoring, and automation.
- **Foundation for Deployment:** Ensures that all subsequent resources (such as Kafka, databases, and applications) can be deployed into a well-defined, isolated environment.
