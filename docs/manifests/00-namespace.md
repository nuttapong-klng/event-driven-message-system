# Explanation of `pod-explaination.md`

This document explains the purpose and content of the file `docs/pod-explaination.md`, which summarizes which Kubernetes manifests in your `k8s/` directory are responsible for creating pods in your cluster.

---

## Purpose of the File

The `pod-explaination.md` file is designed to help you (or any reader) quickly understand which Kubernetes manifests in your project actually result in running pods, and what those pods are for. This is useful for troubleshooting, onboarding, or architecture review.

---

## Structure and Content

### 1. Introduction

- The file starts with a brief statement explaining that it will list which Kubernetes configurations in the `k8s/` directory result in the creation of pods.

### 2. Resources That Define Pods

- This section lists, in detail, each type of Kubernetes resource that leads to pod creation:
  - **StatefulSet**: Used for the PostgreSQL database.
  - **Deployment**: Used for the backend, consumer, and frontend applications.
  - **Job**: Used for a one-time initialization task.
  - **Kafka (Custom Resource)**: Managed by the Strimzi operator, which creates pods for Kafka brokers, Zookeeper, and entity operators.

### 3. Summary Table

- A concise table summarizes all the resources that create pods:
  - **File**: The YAML file where the resource is defined.
  - **Kind**: The type of Kubernetes resource (e.g., Deployment, StatefulSet, Job, Kafka CR).
  - **Name**: The name of the resource.
  - **Results in Pod(s)?**: Indicates if the resource results in pod creation.
  - **Purpose**: A short description of what the pods are for.

### 4. Notes

- This section clarifies that:
  - Not all Kubernetes resources create pods (e.g., Service, ConfigMap, Secret do not).
  - The Strimzi operator is responsible for creating Kafka-related pods based on custom resources.
  - The `kind-config.yaml` file is only for cluster setup and does not define pods.

## Why This File Is Useful

- **Quick Reference**: You can quickly see which files and resources are responsible for running workloads (pods) in your cluster.
- **Onboarding**: New team members can understand the architecture and deployment at a glance.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you're looking for where a particular pod comes from, this file points you to the right manifest.
- **Documentation**: It improves the overall documentation and maintainability of your Kubernetes setup.
